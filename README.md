- utils.py contains the FKL and RKL losses described in the paper, and classes to handle multivariate normal distributions and Gaussian Mixture Models in our experiments.
- ImportanceSamplingFKL.ipynb contains all our experiments as described in the report.
- Report.pdf is the project report associated with this repository.
- requirements.txt contains the list of dependencies of the project.

## Running the code

You can install the dependencies using:

```
conda create -n <environment-name>
conda activate <environment-name>
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
